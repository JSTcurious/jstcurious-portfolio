      <h2>JST + Curious + AI + 42</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Jitender Singh Thakur - 'Jee-thoo' for short. I'm a lifelong learner with a deep curiosity for how things work, how systems evolve, and how human and artificial intelligence shape our world.</p>

      <p><strong>JST</strong> – These are simply my initials.</p>

      <p><strong>Curious</strong> –Curiosity has always been my driving force. Whether I’m analyzing data, experimenting with new technologies, or questioning how decisions are made, curiosity fuels my work. It’s not just a mindset—it’s a core value.</p>

      <p><strong>AI</strong> – To me, AI means more than Artificial Intelligence. It’s Augmented Imagination—a creative and analytical partner in solving problems and designing systems. I see AI as the most powerful tool we’ve built to extend human thinking.</p>

      <p><strong>42</strong> – Yes, it’s a nod to The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, where 42 is the answer to the ultimate question. But it’s also a familiar seed value in data science—a symbol of structured randomness, playful precision, and meaningful experimentation.</p>

      <p>This site is part portfolio, part playground. It’s where I document what I’m learning, building, and contributing—as I continue evolving in the world of AI/GenAI engineering.</p>

      <p>Take a look around—this site reflects what I’m building and learning in real time. If anything resonates with you, I’d be glad to share more about my journey and see how we might collaborate.</p>
