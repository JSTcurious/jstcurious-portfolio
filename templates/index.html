<h2>About JST + Curious + AI + 42</h2>
<p>Hi, I’m Jitender S. Thakur, or my initials JST. I’ve always been a lifelong learner, curious about how things work, how systems grow, and how intelligence—both human and machine—continues to evolve.</p>
<p>The name of this portal is more than just a label. It’s a reflection of the way I think.</p>
<p><strong>Curious</strong> – because that’s my natural state. Whether I’m diving into a dataset, building something new, or questioning how we make decisions, curiosity is what drives me. It’s not just a trait, it’s a mindset that opens up possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>AI</strong> – of course, it stands for Artificial Intelligence, but for me it also means Augmented Imagination. It’s how I explore, design, and solve problems. I see AI as the most advanced form of thinking power we’ve built so far—and I love working with it.</p>
<p><strong>42</strong> – a subtle nod to The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, where 42 is famously the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything. But for any data scientist, it’s also a familiar seed value—hardcoded into randomness. It’s funny how often we start our experiments with 42. I like that dual meaning: both playful and technical, both deep and a little absurd.</p>
<p>So it all comes together here—with me, JST. An engineer turned data storyteller, someone who’s always learning, always building, and always staying curious.</p>
