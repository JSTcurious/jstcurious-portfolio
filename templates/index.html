  <h2>About JST + Curious + AI + 42</h2>
  <p><strong>Hi, I’m Jitender,</strong> or just 'Jee+thoo' for close family and friends. I’ve always been a lifelong learner, curious about how things work, how systems grow, and how intelligence—both human and machine—continues to evolve.</p>

  <blockquote><strong>JST</strong> – the initials of my full name, Jitender Singh Thakur.</blockquote>

  <h3>Why Curious?</h3>
  <p><strong>Curious</strong> – because that’s my natural state. Whether I’m diving into a dataset, building something new, or questioning how we make decisions, curiosity is what drives me. It’s not just a trait, it’s a mindset that opens up possibilities.</p>

  <h3>Why AI?</h3>
  <p><strong>AI</strong> – of course, it stands for Artificial Intelligence, but for me it also means Augmented Imagination. It’s how I explore, design, and solve problems. I see AI as the most advanced form of thinking power we’ve built so far—and I love working with it.</p>

  <h3>Why 42?</h3>
  <p><strong>42</strong> – a subtle nod to The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, where 42 is famously the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything. But for any data scientist, it’s also a familiar seed value—hardcoded into randomness. It’s funny how often we start our experiments with 42. I like that dual meaning: both playful and technical, both deep and a little absurd.</p>

  <p>So it all comes together here—with me, JST. An engineer turned data storyteller, someone who’s always learning, always building, and always staying curious.</p>

  <p>This site is a living, evolving space—part portfolio, part playground—where I share my lifelong learning and professional journey. It’s my way of documenting what I’m exploring, building, and becoming.</p>

  <p>If any part of it resonates with you, I’d love to connect, collaborate, or just exchange ideas.</p>
